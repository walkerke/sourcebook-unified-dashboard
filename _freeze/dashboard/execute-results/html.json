According to the National Housing Preservation Database, over 171,000 rental homes in Virginia receive subsidies to lower their rents, representing a significant portion of the affordable housing stock.</p>\n<p>Assisted rental housing includes several major federal programs along with state and local initiatives. These programs are essential for providing housing opportunities for households that cannot afford market-rate rents.</p>\n<h2>Assisted rental units by program type</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows assisted rental housing by program type. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is the most common form of rental assistance in Virginia, with approximately 91,599 rental homes supported by LIHTCs provided by Virginia Housing.</p>\n<p>Major assisted housing programs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC):</strong>\n Properties developed with federal tax credit financing, typically affordable for 30+ years\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8):</strong>\n Tenant-based rental assistance that can be used in private market housing\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Housing:</strong>\n Government-owned rental housing for low-income families\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project-Based Section 8:</strong>\n Property-based rental assistance attached to specific housing developments\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>USDA Rural Development:</strong>\n Rental assistance and property development in rural areas\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other HUD Programs:</strong>\n Including Section 202 elderly housing and Section 811 disability housing\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.</p>\n<div class=\"app-container\">\n<iframe data-base-url=\"https://example-assisted-by-program.connect.posit.cloud/\" src=\"https://example-assisted-by-program.connect.posit.cloud/?geo=state\" width=\"100%\" height=\"70vh\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 8px;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2>Assisted housing as share of total rental stock</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows assisted rental housing as a percentage of the total rental housing stock.

Cost burden is generally defined as paying more than 30 percent of household income for housing (rent or mortgage, plus associated utilities). Severe cost burden occurs when households pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing.</p>\n<p>Cost burden is the most widely used measure of housing affordability. Households that are cost-burdened have less money available for other necessities like food, healthcare, transportation, and education. In Virginia, nearly half a million renter households (45 percent) are cost burdened.</p>\n<h2>Cost burden by income level</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows cost burden rates by Area Median Income (AMI) categories. Most of the cost-burdened renter households in Virginia are those earning 50 percent AMI or below. Extremely low-income (ELI) households earning 30% AMI or less face particularly severe challenges, with 85 percent being cost-burdened and 65 percent being severely cost-burdened.</p>\n<p>Income categories include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Extremely Low Income (ELI):</strong>\n 30% AMI and below\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Very Low Income (VLI):</strong>\n 31-50% AMI\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Low Income:</strong>\n 51-80% AMI\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Moderate Income:</strong>\n 81-100% AMI\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Above Moderate Income:</strong>\n Over 100% AMI\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.</p>\n<div class=\"app-container\">\n<iframe data-base-url=\"https://example-cost-burden-income.connect.posit.cloud/\" src=\"https://example-cost-burden-income.connect.posit.cloud/?geo=state\" width=\"100%\" height=\"70vh\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 8px;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2>Cost burden by race and ethnicity</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows cost burden rates by race and ethnicity.

In Virginia, there are over 300,000 cost-burdened renters who have very low incomes, resulting in a corresponding gap of over 300,000 deeply affordable rental units.</p>\n<p>The rental housing gap analysis compares the number of renter households at different income levels to the supply of rental units that are affordable and available to them. A gap occurs when there are more households than affordable units at a given income level.</p>\n<h2>Affordable and available units by income level</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows the supply of rental housing that is both affordable and available to households at different income levels. A unit is considered 'affordable' if it costs no more than 30% of a household's income. A unit is 'available' if it is either vacant or occupied by a household in the target income range.</p>\n<p>Income levels are expressed as percentages of Area Median Income (AMI):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Extremely Low Income:</strong>\n 30% AMI and below (approximately $24,000 for a family of four in Virginia)\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Very Low Income:</strong>\n 31-50% AMI (approximately $24,001-$40,000 for a family of four)\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Low Income:</strong>\n 51-80% AMI (approximately $40,001-$64,000 for a family of four)\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.</p>\n<div class=\"app-container\">\n<iframe data-base-url=\"https://example-affordable-available.connect.posit.cloud/\" src=\"https://example-affordable-available.connect.posit.cloud/?geo=state\" width=\"100%\" height=\"70vh\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 8px;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2>Housing gap by income level</h2>\n<p>This dashboard shows the shortage or surplus of affordable rental housing at each income level.
